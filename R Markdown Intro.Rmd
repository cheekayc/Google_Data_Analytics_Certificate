## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring 
* HTML
* PDF
* MS Word documents 

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> or click [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Pictures

You can also embed pictures, but the pictures need to be stored in the same folder as this R Project. For example:     
1. Download a [picture](https://tenor.com/view/bubu-yier-iklog-gif-21667683) from the internet.                       
2. Save this picture in the same folder with this R Project.                                                           
3. Now embed the picture in a new line below.
